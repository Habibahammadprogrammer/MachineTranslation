# Machine Translation on an english-german dataset 
This NLP task has been made using 3 architectures 
  1. Simple Seq2Seq LSTM Model
  2. Transformer From Scratch
  3. Pre-trained GPT-2 transformer
I used libraries like spacy and huggingface transformers to help with the implemntaion of the Transformer and used Pytorch instead of TensorFlow for its GPU acceleration
